                    To put it into perspective, every minute, approximately 500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube,
                    over 500,000 tweets are sent on Twitter, and about 4 million Google searches are conducted.
                    That's just a glimpse of the immense data landscape we navigate daily, shaping our digital footprint and the way we interact with information.
